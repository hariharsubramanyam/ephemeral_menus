# Introduction

This is an implementation of the system described in:

http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~leahkf/pubs/CHI2009-findlater-ephemeral.pdf

It allows you to configure and administer a study which compares ephemeral menus and static menus.

Collaboration Statement: I did not work with anybody else to implement this program.

# Demo

# Requirements

This requires node.js and it has been tested with Chrome.

# Usage

In the top level directory, run

> npm install

and then start the server with:

> node server.js

and open your browser (Google Chrome please!) and navigate to 

> http://localhost:8080

and that's how you take the experiment!

if you want to change the configuration, edit `experiment_config.json`
