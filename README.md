This is an implementation of the system described in:

http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~leahkf/pubs/CHI2009-findlater-ephemeral.pdf

It allows you to configure and administer a study which compares ephemeral menus and static menus.

This requires node.js and it has been tested with Chrome.

# Usage

In the top level directory, run

`npm install`

and then start the server with:

`node server.js`

and open your browser (Google Chrome please!) and navigate to 

`http://localhost:5000`

and that's how you take the experiment!

if you want to change the configuration, edit `experiment_config.json`
